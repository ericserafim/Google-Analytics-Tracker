# Google-Analytics-Tracker

This project is a wrapper for the Google Analytics API to track events from an application. You can use it in Windowns Application or other use case taht you need.

For example I developed a Delphi component to track every event of this application. To do that I used this DLL (Google Analytics Tracker), it was very simple to use and release the solution.
